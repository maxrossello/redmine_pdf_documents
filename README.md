# Redmine PDF Documents

## Introduction

This plugin creates pdf documents containing selected wiki pages.

This project is currently work in progress and I am planing an complete rewrite after I've finished all the features I wan't to include.

## Compatibility

The plugin has been developed for Redmine Version 1.3.x and patched to work in Redmine 1.4.x to.
I don't run any Redmine 2.x installation so perhaps I would port it to Redmine 2.0 if I have one.
